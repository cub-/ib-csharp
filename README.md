Interactive Brokers C# Api

## 2018 update:

ibcsharp is custom made code utilizing event driven, instead of the official wrapper design. In 2018 Mr krs43 decides to upgrade .net Core implementation. However my environment is still VS 2013 and I don't plan to upgrade soon. I decided to keep this fork, maybe some updates to patch the new API change in the future.
